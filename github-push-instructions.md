# Pushing NoCodeAssets to GitHub

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub's new repository page](https://github.com/new)
2. Name your repository (e.g., `nocodeassets-marketplace`)
3. Add an optional description
4. Choose whether to make it public or private
5. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Push Your Local Repository to GitHub

Run the following commands in your terminal, replacing `YOUR_USERNAME` and `REPO_NAME` with your GitHub username and the name of the repository you just created:

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory if you're not already there
cd nocodeassets

# Initialize Git repository (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files to staging
git add .

# Commit the files
git commit -m "Initial commit: NoCodeAssets marketplace MVP"

# Add the GitHub repository as a remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git

# Rename the default branch to main
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify the Push

1. Refresh your GitHub repository page
