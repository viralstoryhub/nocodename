# Instructions to Restructure Your Repository

To fix the Netlify deployment issue, you need to move all the project files from the `nocodeassets` directory to the root of your repository. Here's how to do it:

## Option 1: Using GitHub Web Interface

1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/viralstoryhub/nocodename
2. Navigate to the `nocodeassets` directory
3. For each file and directory inside `nocodeassets`:
   - Click on the file/directory
   - Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) for files
   - Copy the content
   - Go back to the root of the repository
   - Create a new file with the same name
   - Paste the content
   - Commit the changes
4. Once all files are copied to the root, you can delete the `nocodeassets` directory

## Option 2: Using Git Command Line

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/viralstoryhub/nocodename.git
cd nocodename

# Move all files from nocodeassets to the root
mv nocodeassets/* .
mv nocodeassets/.* . 2>/dev/null || true

# Remove the now-empty directory
rmdir nocodeassets

# Commit and push the changes
git add .
git commit -m "Restructure repository for Netlify deployment"
git push
```

## Option 3: Start Fresh

If the above options seem complicated, you can also start fresh:

1. Delete the current repository or create a new one
2. Upload all the files directly to the root of the repository

## After Restructuring

Once you've restructured the repository, Netlify should be able to find the `package.json` file in the root directory and build your project successfully.
